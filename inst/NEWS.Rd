\section{Changes in mboost version 2.9-0 (2018-06-08)}{
  \subsection{User-visible changes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Added family \code{RCG} for ratio of correlated gammas and downstream test, 
        see Weinhold et al. (2016).
        Closes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/86}{#86}.
      \item Removed corrected cross-validation for Cox models (Verweij and van Houwelingen, 1993)
        as it was not working. Closes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/85}{#85}.
      \item Use \code{partykit::ctree} instead of \code{party::ctree} in
        \code{btree} and \code{blackboost}. This is slower but more flexible.
      \item Allow multivariate negative gradients. Note that all
        elements are updated simultaneously, which in most cases
        is NOT what you want (but in rare cases it is the right thing to do).
      \item Allow the specification of either \code{mstop} or \code{grid} in \code{stabsel}.
      \item Allow leave-one-out crossvalidation (via \code{type = "kfold"}).
    }
  }
  \subsection{Bug-fixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Throw error when data is not compatibel (instead of silently recycling the vector). 
        Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/79}{#79}.
      \item Fixed handling of \code{offset} for families \code{NBinomial} and \code{Hurdle}.
        Closes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/88}{#88}.
      \item Replace \code{cBind} (now deprecated) with \code{cbind}. 
        Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/90}{#90}.
      \item Fix \code{predict} with zero iterations (names were not correctly assigned).
        Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/87}{#87}.
      \item Fixed labels in plot function for categorical base-learners.
    }
  }
  \subsection{Miscellaneous}{

        Closes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/81}{#81}.
    }
  }
  \subsection{Miscellaneous}{
    \itemize{
      \item Minor speed ups in \code{df2lambda} (i.e., when computing penalty parameter 
        for the defined degrees of freedom). Changes proposed by Benjamin 
        Christoffersen.

        as requested by CRAN. Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/81}{#82}
      \item Use "old" definition of degrees of freedom in 
        \code{vignette("mboost", package = "mboost")} to make results reproducible.
    }
  }
  \subsection{Bug-fixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Fix handling of missing values in \code{mboost} and \code{gamboost}
        when weights are specified. Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/80}{#80}.

\section{Changes in mboost version 2.8-0 (2017-05-04)}{
  \subsection{User-visible changes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Models with zero steps (i.e., models containing only the offset) can
        now be fitted. Furthermore, cross-validation can now also select a model
        without base-learners.
        Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/64}{#64}, 
        \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/66}{#66}, and 
        \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/69}{#69}.        
      \item \code{Binomial} now uses link functions by making use of \code{make.link}. 
        Furthermore, an alternative implementation of \code{Binomial} models 
        along the lines of the \code{glm} implementation can be used via 
        \code{Binomial(type = "glm")}. Additionally, it works not only with a 
        two-level factor but also with a two-column matrix containing the number 
        of successes and number of failures. 
        Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/34}{#34}, 
        \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/63}{#63} and
        \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/65}{#65}.
      \item Added new base-learner \code{bkernel} for kernel boosting as described in
      
        S. Friedrichs, J. Manitz, P. Burger, C.I. Amos, A. Risch, J.C. Chang-Claude, 
        H.E. Wichmann, T. Kneib, H. Bickeboeller, and B. Hofner (2017), 
        Pathway-Based Kernel Boosting for the Analysis of Genome-Wide Association Studies.

        \doi{10.1155/2017/6742763}.
        
      \item Removed check if \code{df2lambda} is stable. Hence,  
        \code{options(mboost_check_df2lambda)} (introduced in mboost 2.5-0) 
        is no longer used. 
        Closes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/26}{#26}.
    }
  }
  \subsection{Miscellaneous}{
    \itemize{
      \item Added Andreas Mayr as contributor.
      \item Updated references and added reference to \code{citation("mboost")}.
      \item Fixed code of India example, which can be used to reproduce the data analysis 
        presented in
        
        N. Fenske, T. Kneib, and T. Hothorn (2011), 
        Identifying risk factors for severe childhood malnutrition by boosting 
        additive quantile regression.
        \emph{Journal of the American Statistical Association}, \bold{106}:494-510.
	      
	    (see \code{system.file("India_quantiles.R", package = "mboost")})
	  \item Fixed package citation.
	  \item Register C routines to make CRAN happy (again).
        Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/77}{#77}. 
    }
  }
  \subsection{Bug-fixes}{
     \itemize{
       \item Make sure that \code{family = Multinomial} is only used with Kronecker 
         product base-learners. Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/46}{#46}.
      \item Use argument \code{PACKAGE} in \code{.Call}. 
         Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/72}{#72}.
      \item If \code{center} is specified as boolean value in \code{bols}, we now throw an error. 
         Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/70}{#70}.
      \item  Fixed \code{AUC} family which expected fit to be equal to a constant in the 
        first iteration.
      \item Check for new data, e.g., in \code{predict}, was broken.
        Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/68}{#68}. 
     \item Make sure that \code{newdata} is discarded in \code{fitted}. 
        Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/76}{#76}.

      A dedicated plot function exists (\code{plot(varimp())}). Code was provided 
      by Tobias Kuehn and Almond Stoecker. 
      See pull request \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/pull/29}{#29}.
      \item Improved \code{plot} function for boosting models:
      \itemize{
        \item \code{plot} fails earlier in case of multiple \code{levelplots},
          i.e., maps (thanks to Mikko Korpela).
          See pull request \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/pull/39}{#39}.
        \item Provide sensible defaults for \code{xlab} and \code{ylab} and allow 
          user-specified axis labels for bi- and multivariate plots.
          Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/51}{#51}.
        \item Export \code{plot} functions (\code{plot.glmboost}, \code{plot.mboost}, 
          \code{lines.mboost}, \code{plot.varimp} and \code{plot.cvrisk}) for 
          better usability and visibility.

    \itemize{
      \item Updated manual regarding the usage of families and clarified the usage 
        of argument \code{qoffset}.
      \item Updated manual for base-learners:
      \itemize{
        \item Highlight that \code{x} should be centered if \code{bols(x, intercept = FALSE)} 
          is used.
        \item Discourage using \code{bbs(, constraint != "none")}; Preferably use 
          \code{bmono} for constrained effect estimates.
          Fixes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/36}{#36}.
      }
      \item Improved vignettes (thanks to Mikko Korpela).

    \itemize{
      \item New maintainer: Benjamin Hofner follows Torsten Hothorn as
      maintainer.
      \item Package \pkg{party} is now imported. \pkg{mboost} no longer
      directly relies on unexported functions.
      \item  Allow extrapolation for predictions if kronecker products,
      tensor  products or sums are used. Fixes
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/23}{#23}.
      \item Development now hosted entirely on github as
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/}{boost-R/mboost}.
      \item Started using \pkg{testthat}.
    }
  }
  \subsection{Miscellaneous}{
    \itemize{
      \item Improved checks for \code{newdata}: Warnings are no longer
      issued if data has just different types of numeric values (i.e.,
      integer vs. double). Resolves issue
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/17}{#17}.
      \item Fixed \file{CITATION} by removing duplicated string 'R package
      version' (spotted by Heidi Seibold).
      \item \code{predict}: Improve warning when \code{length(offset) >
	1}. Closes issue
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/20}{#20}.
      \item Added test coverage using package \pkg{covr}.
      \item Better error handling in \code{cvrisk} also for parallel
      processes.
      \item Suppress warning of \code{rankMatrix}. (Resolves issue
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/24}{#24}).
      \item Stop exporting internal functions for \pkg{FDboost}. Use
      \code{mboost_intern()} instead. Caution: Do not use this function.
    }
  }
  \subsection{Bug-fixes}{
     \itemize{
       \item Handling of missing values has been improved. Resolves issue
       \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/12}{#12}.
       \item Minor bug fixed in vignette
       \file{mboost_illustrations.Rnw}.

}

\section{Changes in mboost version 2.5-0 (2015-08-13)}{
  \subsection{User-visible changes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Added documentation for \code{plot.mboost} function and moved
      documentation of \code{plot.glmboost} to the same help page.
      Resolves issue \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/14}{#14}.
      \item \code{bbs} and \code{bmono} no longer allow data outside of
      the \code{boundary.knots} during model fitting.
      \item Predictions for \code{bbs} and \code{bmono} now use linear
      extrapolation (user request inspired by
      \code{mgcv::Predict.matrix.pspline.smooth}).
      \item Better handling of errors in (single) folds of \code{cvrisk}:
      results of folds without errors are used and a \code{warning} is
      issued.
      \item Parallel computing via \code{mclapply}: Set
      \code{mc.preschedule = FALSE} per default.
      \item Added new option \code{options(mboost_check_df2lambda =
	TRUE)}, which controls if a stability check in \code{df2lambda}
      is performed. If set to \code{FALSE} this might speed up the
      computation of \code{df2lambda} especially with large design
      matrices.
      \item Prediction now also possible with \code{newdata = list()}.
      Resolves issue
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/15}{#15}.

  }
  \subsection{Miscellaneous}{
    \itemize{
      \item \code{PropOdds()}: Updated manual for proportional odds model.
      \item \code{Multinomial()}: Updated manual for multinomial logit
      model. Predictions for new data are now
      possible (resolves issue
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/13}{#13}, thanks to
      Sarah Brockhaus).
      \item \file{inst/CITATION}: Added subheadings and
      tutorial paper.
      \item Stopped computing the singular vectors in \code{df2lambda}
      as the singular values are sufficient and as
      \dQuote{computing the singular vectors is the slow part for large
	matrices} (proposed by Fabian Scheipl).
    }
  }
  \subsection{Bug-fixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Fixed bug in \code{PropOdds()} which occurred if
      \code{offset} was specified: nuisance parameters \code{delta}
      and \code{sigma} were not properly initialized (spotted by Madlene Nussbaum).
      \item Bug in \code{plot.mboost()} fixed which occurred if a factor
      with equal effect estimates for different categories was plotted.
      \item Bug in \code{df2lambda} fixed: Make sure that \code{A} is
      symmetric if it is \code{Matrix}-object (spotted by Souhaib Ben
      Taieb).
      \item Bug in \code{df2lambda} fixed. Design matrices were always
      assumed to be of full rank.
      \item Truncate output of complete data structure when model is
      printed. Resolves issue
      \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/11}{#11}.
      \item  Adhere to CRAN policies regarding import of base packages
      (closes \href{https://github.com/boost-R/mboost/issues/9}{#9}).

  \subsection{Miscellaneous}{
    \itemize{
      \item Moved generic definition of \code{selected} to \pkg{stabs}
      which is required anyway (thus, \pkg{stabs} >= 0.5-0 is now
      required)
      \item load AML dataset (\file{AML_Bullinger.rda}) from package

  \subsection{Bug-fixes}{
    \itemize{
      \item Cross-validation was potentially wrong for \code{CoxPH()}
      models. Users can now choose if they want the naive
      cross-validation or the improved version by Verweij and van
      Houwelingen (1993); (spotted by Holger Reulen <hreulen _ at _

  \itemize{

    \item \code{bbs(..., center = "spectralDecomp")} computes the spectral
    decomposition of the penalty matrix and the penalized part of the
    design matrix is defined by this decomposition.

    Experiments show that \code{bols(x) + bbs(x, center = "spectralDecomp")}
    is a little better in recovering the true underlying functions than
    the default \code{bols(x) + bbs(x, center = TRUE)} or, equivalently,
    \code{bols(x) + bbs(x, center = "differenceMatrix")}.

    For \code{bbs(x, y, center = TRUE)} or \code{bmrf(x, center = TRUE)},
    the spectral decomposition is (and was) always used.

    \item fixed bug in \code{stabsel}: \code{'...'} was not passed to
         \code{cvrisk} and thus one could not specify options for \code{mclapply}
    \item fixed bug in \code{brandom}: now really use
    \code{contrasts.arg = "contr.dummy"} per default.

         \code{FWER} in stability selection is greater (by a certain
         margin) than the specified bound.

    \item changed default for \code{options("mboost_dftraceS")} to \code{FALSE}, i.e.,
         degrees of freedom are now computed from smoothing parameter
         as described in B. Hofner, T. Hothorn, T. Kneib, M. Schmid (2011).
    \item changed computation of B-spline basis at the boundaries:
         now also use equidistant knots in the boundaries (per default)

\section{Changes in mboost version 0.5-0 (2007-01-30)}{
  \itemize{
    \item new \code{baselearner} argument to \code{gamboost} allowing to
         specify difference component-wise base-learners to
         be used. Currently implemented: "ssp" for smoothing splines
         (default), "bsp" for B-splines and "ols" for linear models.
         The latter two haven't been tested yet.
    \item The \code{dfbase} arguments now applies to each covariate and
         no longer to each column of the design matrix.
    \item cvrisk() for blackboost() was broken, totally :-(
    \item centered covariates were returned by glmboost() and gamboost()
    \item Poisson() used an incorrect offset
    \item check for y being positive counts when family = "Poisson()"[B
    \item checks for Poisson() logLik() and AIC() methods
    \item fire a warning when all u > 0 or u < 0
    \item update vignette \file{mboost_illustrations}
