  o  plot() method for `glmboost' objects visualizing the
     coefficient path (feature request by Axel Benner <benner@dkfz.de>).

  o  predict() for gamboost(..., dfbase = 1) was not working correctly

  o  small performance and memory improvements for glmboost()

		CHANGES in `mboost' VERSION 0.5-0 (2007-01-30)

  o  new `baselearner' argument to `gamboost' allowing to
     specify difference component-wise base-learners to
     be used. Currently implemented: "ssp" for smoothing splines
     (default), "bsp" for B-splines and "ols" for linear models.
     The latter two haven't been tested yet.

  o  The `dfbase' arguments now applies to each covariate and 
     no longer to each column of the design matrix.

  o  cvrisk() for blackboost() was broken, totally :-(

  o  centered covariates were returned by glmboost() and gamboost()

     factors when the response was actually a factor

  o  report offset in print methods

  o  add offset attribute to coef.glmboost


		CHANGES in `mboost' VERSION 0.4-11 (2006-09-07)

  o  Huber() is `Huber Error', not `Huber Absolute Error'

  o  added `CoxPH' family object for fitting Cox models

  o  remove inst/LaTeX
